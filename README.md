Notes on the project:

After first compilation run server first with your arguments. Then, any number of clients can be executed.

If you want to re-run the server, make sure clear the comments starting from server.c line 253 to 265. Then, compile and run twice while those comments are cleared. This is for clean-up purposes, since server is not supposed to terminate, there is no need to do auto clean-up. Therefore, it needs to be done by hand for re-executing.
